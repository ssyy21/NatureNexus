# NatureNexus

This is the hackathon project of our team Bio Blaze.
The problem:
As we know , Consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their purchases, but they often lack reliable information to make sustainable choices. The market is flooded with products claiming to be eco-friendly, but there is no standard verification process, leading to confusion and mistrust.

The solution : (NatureNexus)
To address these issues, we are set on creating a comprehensive website 'Nature Nexus' a complete marketplace that promotes and sells products supporting biodiversity and sustainability. We verify sellers' sustainability claims and provide transparent information about each product's environmental impact.
